<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE MALTESE KITTY.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapo"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span> Hatty! see that pretty
kitty! I wonder where
she came from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred Carleton walked softly toward
the puss, his hand outstretched,
calling, &ldquo;Kitty, pretty kitty,&rdquo; until
he had her in his arms.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
His sister Hatty took her hands
from the dish-water, wiped them on
the roller, and came toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why Fred!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s Ned Perry&rsquo;s kitty. Clara
says it&rsquo;s a real Maltese. They&rsquo;ll feel
dreadfully when they know it&rsquo;s
lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo;
said Fred, caressing the puss;
&ldquo;see how she loves me! I&rsquo;d like to
keep her so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would you have Ned, who
is a roguish boy, catch one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
your bantams and keep it? You&rsquo;d
call that stealing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred sighed. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t go to
catch her, Hatty; she came right
into the door. I think that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she is hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Hatty! may I try her with
some milk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, laughing
at his eagerness. &ldquo;Pour some into
a saucer from the pitcher in the
closet, and see whether she will
drink it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
He was rewarded by the sight of
pussy lapping up the milk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do believe kitty is thanking
me,&rdquo; he said, laughing and clapping
his hands. &ldquo;See how she
keeps looking up! I never saw a
kitty do so before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Puss did, indeed, seem to be
grateful. She lapped away at the
milk with great eagerness, and
then she would look in the face
of her benefactor, and utter a soft
little mew.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Pussy Lapping the Milk.</span> Page <a href="#Page_14">14</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederick,&rdquo; called out Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
Carleton from the head of the
stairs, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it time for you to go
to school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Saturday, ma; I don&rsquo;t go
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;well,
come up here a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred obeyed, carrying kitty in
his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pretty puss!&rdquo; his
mother exclaimed; &ldquo;where did you
find her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred, standing very erect and
firm, told all the circumstances
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
relating to his new friend, and then
asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carry her to Mrs. Perry, to be
sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a long walk, and it&rsquo;s
awful muddy, ma. Couldn&rsquo;t I let
her stay here, and tell Ned at
Sabbath school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the way you would like
Ned to do, if the kitty were yours?
Perhaps he is looking everywhere
for her now, and mourning because
his pet is lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
Frederick sat for a moment
stroking the cat&rsquo;s soft fur; then
he started up, exclaiming, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go right off. I don&rsquo;t care if it is
muddy. I know Ned will be so
glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was indeed quite a task for a
child of only eight years to carry
a half-grown cat over a muddy
road for a third of a mile. But
Fred anticipated, with delight, the
pleasure he should give, and the
thanks he would receive. Once
kitty, not liking to be held so tightly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
escaped from his arms, and led
him a chase over the wall into a
marshy field; but he caught her
again at last, and laughed alone by
himself, imagining how Ned and
Clara would run to meet him as soon
as they saw what he was carrying.</p>

<p>Hatty had finished washing the
dishes, and had swept the dining-room
and kitchen, when, happening
to look from the window, she saw
Fred coming back.</p>

<p>He scraped the mud from his
boots and came into the kitchen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
his face expressive of the greatest
disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; inquired
his sister, laughing at his
comical expression; &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you get
the kitty safe home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, weren&rsquo;t they glad to find
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anybody but Mrs.
Perry, and she was just as cross as
she could be. She never thanked
me one mite. She only looked at
my boots as if she was afraid I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
was going to walk in, and then she
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, put her down; cats are a
great bother, any way.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell Mrs. Perry
you would take her back again? I
should think she might have
thanked you, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate not to be thanked,&rdquo; exclaimed
Fred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Especially when you took pains
to go so far through all this mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next time kitty comes here,
crying and trying to come in, I&rsquo;ll
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
keep her myself. I&rsquo;m as tired as
I can be, I had to chase her so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred took off his boots, and went
up stairs, where his mother sat sewing,
to relate his grievances to
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>NO THANKS.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>RS. CARLETON was at
work on a new suit of
clothes. They were of a
soft gray cloth, and made in a fashion
which greatly pleased the little
boy. First, there was a pair of pantaloons,
or pants, as Fred called them;
then a vest, he had never worn a vest
before; and last, a nice jacket with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
a pocket in the left side, just like
the ones worn by the big boys.
The jacket and vest were bound
with black braid.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton had taken great pains
with the new suit. First, she had
to give more for the cloth than she
could well afford; but she admired
its soft, firm texture, and willingly
gave up a new black silk apron
which she expected to purchase:
the money thus saved met the
extra expense of the cloth.</p>

<p>Next, came the fitting of the suit.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
There was no children&rsquo;s tailor in
the town; and, if there had been,
Mrs. Carleton could not afford to
pay him for the cutting. So she
sent to her sister in the city, who
kindly furnished a paper pattern,
which she had used for her own
son.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of trouble
in all this; but the mother took it
cheerfully, rising earlier than usual,
and sitting up late, in order to finish
the clothes before the examination
of the school.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
When Fred came up the stairs
she was at work on the vest. She
listened with interest to all he had
to say, especially when he expressed
his displeasure that Mrs. Perry did
not even thank him for carrying her
kitty home.</p>

<p>Finding her too busy to talk
much, he was going downstairs,
when she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Fred; I want
to try on this vest; and then I have
something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need I take off my jacket,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
mother? I&rsquo;ve tried it on so many
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I&rsquo;ve had to alter it a
little. Stand still; I can&rsquo;t pin it
while you are jerking your head so
continually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hurts, ma. I can&rsquo;t bear to
try on clothes,&rdquo; he said, impatiently.
&ldquo;I had rather wear my old ones
than to have to keep changing so
many times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Fred was buttoning his
jacket again, Mrs. Carleton asked,
earnestly,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
&ldquo;Did you say your prayer this
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, I forgot it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you often forget?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good many times I do in the
morning, because I hear the chickens
calling for their dough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t forget to eat your
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, ma, of course not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor to drink when you are
thirsty, nor to warm yourself when
it is cold, nor to lie down to rest
when you are weary.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
&ldquo;Of course, ma, I do that.
Everybody does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Fred, who gives you your
breakfast? Who provides a pleasant
home for you; a fire and clothes
to warm you; a bed for you to rest
upon? Who gives you health and
strength; a good appetite for your
food? Who made your form erect
and vigorous, instead of lame and
deformed, like poor Israel Wasson?
Do you ever think who has done all
these things for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God made me,&rdquo; said the boy;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
&ldquo;and gave me all the blessings
which I enjoy. That&rsquo;s the answer
in my catechism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My little son,&rdquo; said the lady,
seriously; &ldquo;you were much displeased
because Mrs. Perry expressed
no gratitude for the
small favor you did her; but you
confess that many mornings you
forget to thank your heavenly
Father for all his kindness to you.
You said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Catch me carrying her kitty
home through all the mud again.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
&ldquo;What if God should say, &lsquo;I have
given Frederick Carleton a good
home, food to eat, clothes to wear,
a house to live in, and friends to
love him. I have done this for
eight years; but he seldom thanks
me. He jumps out of bed, runs to
his breakfast, satisfies all his wants,
but does not even think of me, the
Giver of all his blessings. I will
do nothing more for him. After
this he shall be a poor, homeless
wanderer, suffering from hunger
and thirst, from cold and nakedness.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
I do hate people who don&rsquo;t
thank me for the favors which I
bestow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE SABBATH SCHOOL.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>HILE his mother was
speaking, Fred had dropped
his cap to the floor,
and sat looking at her, his eyes
staring wide open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, ma,&rdquo; he said, eagerly; &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know that God would care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing, my child, that
our heavenly Father loves more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
than a grateful heart. How often
did David express his gratitude to
the Most High. He says, &lsquo;It is a
good thing to give thanks unto the
Lord, and to sing praises unto thy
name, O Most High! to show
forth thy loving-kindness in the
morning, and thy faithfulness every
night.&rsquo; Again he says, &lsquo;I will bless
thee while I live. Seven times a
day do I praise thee.&rsquo; The Bible
is full of thanks to God for his
continued mercies to his undeserving
creatures. Moses, the great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
lawgiver, commands, &lsquo;When thou
hast eaten and art full, then thou
shalt bless the Lord thy God.&rsquo; Joel
says, &lsquo;Ye shall eat in plenty and be
satisfied, and praise the name of
the Lord thy God.&rsquo; Even Jesus,
who as God, was the Creator of
all things, when he took the seven
loaves, gave God thanks for the
means to satisfy the hunger of all
the multitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it before,
ma. I don&rsquo;t believe I shall forget
again. I know, when you pray
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
with me, you always say, &lsquo;We thank
thee for food and all our blessings;&rsquo;
but I never before thought that he
wanted us to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A grateful heart, Fred, thanks
its benefactor, because it loves to
do so; it cannot help it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, the last
time your father came home, how
pleased you were with the birds
he brought you? You could not
stop thanking him. Over and over
again you said, &lsquo;O pa, I&rsquo;m so much
obliged! These are just what I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
wanted. I&rsquo;m so very glad! And
I thank you so much!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma; I remember all about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think your father was
better pleased than if you had
taken the cage, hung it up by the
window, and said nothing about
the birds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O ma! of course I wouldn&rsquo;t do
that, when he had brought them
over the ocean for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or, suppose Hatty had taken
the beautiful silk he bought for her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
in Canton, carried it to the dressmaker&rsquo;s,
and then worn it without
ever thanking him for his kindness;
would he have been encouraged to
bring her another present, do you
think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, ma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you what I was
thinking when you were trying on
your vest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred held down his head, his
cheeks covered with blushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said to myself, &lsquo;My son feels
very indignant because Mrs. Perry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
did not thank him for carrying
home her cat. Now, if he himself
had a grateful heart, he would
thank me for taking so much pains
with his new suit, instead of being
so sulky about the trifling annoyance
of trying it on. I had better
make the vest anyhow since he
is so ungrateful.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think that, ma? I&rsquo;m
real sorry. I wont act so again. I
have thought ever so much about
it; and last night, after you prayed
with me, I said to myself, &lsquo;I ought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
to be a real good boy, ma&rsquo;s so
kind to sit up and work on my
clothes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned Perry was in the same class
at Sabbath school, as Fred Carleton.
As they were walking home
together, Ned said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how our cat happened
to run away. Mother said
you brought her home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did! If she comes again,
I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t try it through all the mud.
I got awfully tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you keep her?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be looking
everywhere; and Hatty said I ought
to go. I&rsquo;ll give you my new top if
you&rsquo;ll let me keep her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it; for mother hates to
have her round; she kills chickens
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kills chickens! Oh, I guess
that&rsquo;s what she was after at our
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred suddenly remembered that
he had first seen her near the hen-coop;
and he also remembered that
this was Sunday, and that he ought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
not to have been making bargains
about cats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a real good story Miss
Darling told us to-day,&rdquo; he said,
changing the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s a tip-top teacher!
She makes us understand the lesson;
and that&rsquo;s what I never did
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wait here till
Hatty comes up,&rdquo; said Fred, stopping
at the corner where his companion
had to leave him, and looking
earnestly up the street.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
&ldquo;When do you want the kitty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her if she kills
chickens; but I&rsquo;ll talk with Hatty
about it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Ned thank you?&rdquo; asked
Hatty, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he don&rsquo;t want the cat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred then repeated the story
which his teacher had related. The
subject of temperance had come up
in connection with the lesson, and
Miss Darling wished to impress
upon the minds of her class the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
evils of drunkenness. As you may
like to hear the story, I will relate
it in the next chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE DRUNKARD.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span> MAN, living in the State
of Arkansas, was in the
habit of spending his
evenings at a tavern, where he often
became so drunk that he could
scarcely reach home.</p>

<p>One night he stayed later than
usual, so that when he left the tavern,
honest people had long been in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
bed. The liquor he had taken so
bewildered his senses that he knew
not where he was going. At last,
he staggered into an empty wagon-shed
and fell on the ground.</p>

<p>For a long time he lay unconscious
of everything about him, and
would, no doubt, have frozen, as the
night was very cold, had not he
been cared for by others less insensible
than himself.</p>

<p>This shed was a favorite resort
for the hogs, which were out when
the new-comer arrived, but soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
returned to their nest. In the utmost
kindness, they gave the man
the warmest place in the middle of
the bed; some lying close by his
side, and others acting the part of
the quilt. Their company made
him so warm that he was kept from
exposure.</p>

<p>Toward morning he began to
rouse from his drunken sleep, but
felt so comfortable that he supposed
himself still in the tavern with his
companions.</p>

<p>He reached out his hand, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
catching hold of the stiff bristles of
a hog, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mister, when did you
shave last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did Daniel Jones look
while Miss Darling was telling the
story?&rdquo; asked Hatty, much interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked very red. I don&rsquo;t
believe teacher knows what a
drunkard his father is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hatty; &ldquo;you and I
ought to be very thankful that our
father is a temperance man. How
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
should you feel to have him lying
with the hogs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought how many
things we have to be grateful for,&rdquo;
said Fred, gravely. &ldquo;If I had a
father like Dan Jones, I never
could look anybody in the face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton, finding that her
son&rsquo;s mind was still dwelling on
gratitude, promised to relate a story
on the subject, as soon as tea was
cleared away.</p>

<p>While Hatty was doing this,
Fred took his book to learn the lesson
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
for the next Sabbath. He was
nearly through when he noticed
that his sister was trying to lift the
table alone, and set it in its place
next the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me help you, Hatty,&rdquo; he
cried, jumping to her assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Fred,&rdquo; and she
kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to do things for people
who thank me,&rdquo; he replied, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, ma, I know then&mdash;I
know they&rsquo;re pleased. I can&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
explain the reason, only it makes
me feel better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You feel that they appreciate
your kindness. Isn&rsquo;t that the reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma; and then I want to do
something more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said the lady,
&ldquo;when I was a young girl, about
Hatty&rsquo;s age, I went with my aunt
to make a visit to a distant relative.
There were quite a number of children
in the family. When we sat
down to the table, soon after our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
arrival, the boys and girls began
scrambling for food,&mdash;snatching
everything that was within reach.
I looked on in astonishment. My
aunt passed me some bread. &lsquo;I
thank you,&rsquo; I said; and I repeated
the words &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; every time
anything was passed to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last these rude children
began to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who are you thanking so
much?&rsquo; asked one. &lsquo;We never
say &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo; We get all we
can without any such fuss.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;At home,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I was
always taught to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;
for every civility. I think it is much
pleasanter to do so. Wont you try
it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They began at once, in mockery,
to pass each other cake and cheese,
laughing rudely as they repeated
the words, &lsquo;thank you.&rsquo; I was
never so much disgusted, and must
confess, that before we left the supper-table,
I felt somewhat as Frederick
did when Mrs. Perry treated
his kindness so coolly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
&ldquo;How long did you have to stay
there, ma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two days. I was never so
homesick. The mother was a hardworking
woman, toiling from morning
to night for her family. One
evening she sat up till midnight
finishing a pair of mittens for her
oldest son. She told him of this
the next morning; but he did not
express one word of gratitude. He
only said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You might have finished them
earlier if you&rsquo;d been a mind to!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
&ldquo;I would have snatched them
right away,&rdquo; exclaimed Hatty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mother had never taught him
to be grateful. She did not seem
to expect any thanks; but when he
had left the room she sighed heavily
as she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s hard to please children, do
what you will.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the story you promised
us, ma?&rdquo; inquired Frederick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear; I happened to think
of that visit, when you said you
loved to do anything for your sister
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
because she thanks you so heartily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose it was that
visit, ma, that made you so particular
always to say &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; when
I bring in wood, or find eggs, or any
such things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was so disgusted, Fred, with
the want of gratitude to their hardworking
mother, and, indeed, with
the absence of common civility, I
may have thought more on the subject;
but I trust you will find,
wherever you go, that those who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
are most grateful to God for his
mercies are most inclined to thank
each other.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE UNGRATEFUL SON.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcaph"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>ATTY is all ready now,
ma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a very long
story, my dear; but it shows God&rsquo;s
displeasure at ingratitude to parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Birmingham, England, there
once lived a family who were poor.
The father died, at last, and all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
younger children, leaving the
widow with her two eldest sons.
At this time, they had gone into
business, and were able to assist
her; but they forgot all she had
done for them, often denying herself
food that they might have
enough. They forgot the days and
nights she had watched by them in
sickness; and, when she humbly
entreated a little help, they refused
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was so feeble that she could
do little for her own support, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
was obliged with great reluctance
to apply to the parish for assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For two years she received the
small sum of two shillings a week
from the overseers of the poor,
which, with a little help from some
Christian friends, was all she had
to live upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During this time the younger of
these two sons died; not peacefully
on his bed, trusting that Jesus would
forgive all his sins, but in the most
terrible agony both of body and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
mind, cursing and raving because
he must leave all his property, and
go to a world of darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The eldest son was shrewd in
his business, and in a few years
became rich. He was still unmarried;
but he refused again and
again to assist his mother, though
many persons applied to him in her
behalf. He held offices of trust in
the city, but still allowed his infirm
mother to eke out her poor existence
on the parish allowance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last his ungrateful, inhuman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
conduct rendered him so notorious
that he caused her name to be struck
off the parish books, and allowed
her the two shillings from his own
pocket; but not a penny more, even
when he was possessed of thousands
of pounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day some friends of the
old lady were assembled, among
whom was her clergyman. They
expressed great indignation at the
base ingratitude of the son, and
proposed that a remonstrance be
drawn up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the minister; &lsquo;if that
man dies possessed of the property
which he is now worth, I shall be
greatly deceived. God will never
suffer such base ingratitude to prosper.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shortly after, the mother died
a happy death, and very soon
the prospects of her wicked son
began to change. He met with
great losses; and finally he was
reduced to poverty as abject as his
mother&rsquo;s had been. No one pitied
him; but all felt his suffering was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
richly deserved, and was a just punishment
for his sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a wicked man!&rdquo; cried
Frederick. &ldquo;I would never do so;
I would have you live with me, ma,
and take care of you all your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton kissed her boy and
softly whispered in his ear,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my darling;&rdquo; and
then it was time for them to get their
Bibles, and read aloud in turn.
Afterward Mrs. Carleton knelt, and
prayed for herself and her absent
husband, and for their dear children,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
that God would make them
sensible of all his blessings and
would give them hearts to praise
him for his great mercies.</p>

<p>Fred usually fell asleep almost as
soon as his head touched the pillow;
but this night he was very wakeful.
The stories he had heard, both from
his teacher and his mother, led him
to think of the end of wicked men;
and he resolved, as he had never
done before, that, with God&rsquo;s help,
he would try to be a consistent
Christian.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
Especially he thought of his
father, and wondered where he was,
how soon he would be home, and
what kind of a present he would
bring this time.</p>

<p>Fred&rsquo;s father was a sea-captain.
He had once been very successful
in business; but two years before
the time I have written about, his
vessel was wrecked, and he barely
escaped with his life.</p>

<p>As he could not afford to lose his
time in waiting for the command of
a new ship, he took the situation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
of first mate, in which he had continued
ever since. It was now a
few days more than a year since he
sailed, and Hatty noticed that her
mother began to watch the clouds
more than she had done, while she
supposed him too far off the coast
to be affected by storms. Still as he
was not now the captain, he might
not be able to leave the vessel at
once, even if it had arrived in
port.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton said little to her
children of the subject which filled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
her heart; but night after night,
while they were soundly sleeping,
she prayed that he from whom she
had been separated so many weary
months might be brought in safety
to his home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE STRANGE VISITOR.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE day of the examination
arrived at last. The new
suit was completed and
hanging in the closet. The nicely
starched collar, and the pretty brown
bow were laid with a clean pocket-handkerchief
in the drawer.</p>

<p>Fred had been very diligent in
reviewing his lessons; but as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
time drew near when he would be
called out to recite, his heart beat
fast with excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish the examination was
over,&rdquo; he said a dozen times. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
almost sure I shall miss in geography.
I can say my piece just as
well as can be; but when I see all
the people looking, I&rsquo;m afraid I shall
forget every word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The day was fine; and Mrs.
Carleton and Hatty left home at an
early hour so as to secure seats in
the crowded hall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
There was a raised stage at one
end, on which the scholars stood
while examined by the committee,
who occupied seats on the opposite
platform, the visitors filling up all
the vacant space.</p>

<p>The exercises of examination
were interesting to the parents,
each feeling a natural desire that
his or her child should excel; and
then the teacher announced that
there would be speaking from the
first class.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Hatty&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
bright eyes noticed a stranger enter
the door, who was at once invited
to a seat of honor near the
committee.</p>

<p>There was something about his
eyes that startled her. They wandered
quickly about the room as if
in search of some one, and then
fixed themselves gravely upon the
school. The lower part of his face
was completely hidden by a heavy
beard.</p>

<p>Hatty touched her mother, calling
her attention to the stranger;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
but, with scarcely a glance at the
gentleman, Mrs. Carleton gave her
attention to the speaking.</p>

<p>At the close of the school, a
member of the committee, &rsquo;Squire
Long, arose and said to the
teacher,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so much pleased with your
boys, that I am going to indulge
myself with the pleasure of giving
each one of them a book to remember
me by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He untied a parcel, and took out
some prettily bound volumes, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
he proceeded to distribute, to the
great joy of the boys.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em;">
<img src="images/tlk05.jpg" width="413" height="600"
alt="Frederick receives his book" />
</div>

<p>The scholars generally looked
much pleased; but not one, except
Fred Carleton, expressed his gratitude.
When it came his turn to go
forward, his whole face was covered
with a rosy flush. He bowed when
the volume was put in his hands,
and with a cordial &ldquo;I thank you,
sir,&rdquo; retired to his seat.</p>

<p>There were several whispered
comments on Fred&rsquo;s conduct; all
agreeing that he had done well.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
&ldquo;That boy has a good mother,&rdquo;
murmured one of the committee in
the ear of the bearded stranger.</p>

<p>The gentleman only bowed.</p>

<p>In the confusion of leaving the
hall, Hatty lost sight of the strange
visitor; but she could not forget the
impression he had made upon her
and continued to talk about him all
the way home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think where I&rsquo;ve seen
him before. His eyes looked as
familiar as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before they started for the school
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
they had drawn down the curtains
and locked the door, Mrs. Carleton
taking the key in her pocket.
Now, as they approached the
house, they were surprised to see
the curtains up, and the shed door
wide open.</p>

<p>Hatty darted forward to see who
was within, and presently, with a
joyful scream, was held fast in the
arms of the mysterious stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Husband!&rdquo; murmured Mrs.
Carleton, instantly recognizing
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I
see you all once more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you come? How
changed you are! I was sure I
had seen your eye somewhere,&rdquo;
exclaimed Hatty, full of joyful
excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was proud of you, my boy,&rdquo;
said Captain Carleton, again embracing
him. &ldquo;I was proud of you
and proud of your mother, who has
trained you to such good manners.
I pray God you may always honor
her as you did to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
Mrs. Carleton, having laid aside
her bonnet and shawl, rose to make
preparations for supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, ma, you sit right down,&rdquo;
exclaimed Hatty, gently putting her
back into the chair. &ldquo;I can do
everything. You sit and talk with
pa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will find a lobster in the
closet,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;We
can well afford to have a little feast,
for the Adolphus, my new vessel,
is completed, and will be ready for
sea before I am, I fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
&ldquo;Good news! good news! Pa
is captain again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added the gentleman;
&ldquo;the owners have been very generous.
They have allowed me a
sum in advance, which, with what
I have made in the last voyage,
will buy a share in her. I hope for
a prosperous trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have returned safely; and
I could be satisfied with that,&rdquo; faltered
Mrs. Carleton, her eyes full
of tears, though hope prevailed in
her heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>FINDING A PLACE.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>E must now pass over several
years, during which
Captain Carleton was very
much prospered. He had become
rich, and loved to share his wealth
with others.</p>

<p>Hatty was married to a merchant
from the neighboring city; and she,
who had been so dutiful a daughter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
and so loving a sister, bid fair
to be an affectionate wife.</p>

<p>Frederick at sixteen graduated
from the High School with the first
honors. For a time he had been
anxious to go to sea with his father;
but, as his mother was unwilling,
he concluded to be a merchant.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Carleton still remained
in her old home, she wished her son
to obtain business, at least for the
present, in the same town; so one
morning he set out to find himself
a place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
All day long he went from one
store to another; but nowhere was
a boy wanted. He returned home
at night quite disheartened, but,
after a cheerful talk with his
mother, resolved he wouldn&rsquo;t give
up.</p>

<p>There were a few of the largest
stores into which he had not ventured.
Now he said to himself,&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing
venture, nothing have.&rdquo;
So, putting on a resolute face, he
started off to renew his efforts.</p>

<p>There was one immense flour and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
grain store down by the wharf,
owned by Long, Haynes, &amp; Long,
into which he had looked with great
interest.</p>

<p>The vessels, loaded with grain,
came up to the very door, whence
the huge bags were taken by means
of the tackle into the upper stories
of the great storehouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the kind of place I
should like,&rdquo; he said to himself,
watching the men running to and
fro. &ldquo;Business seems lively. I
wonder whether any of the partners
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
are in the counting-room? I
wish somebody would introduce
me; but if I must go alone, I must.
It&rsquo;s no use standing here dreading
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see &rsquo;Squire Long,&rdquo;
he said, addressing a man who
wore a meal-bag apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to the counting-room, then;&rdquo;
and the porter was gone without
another word.</p>

<p>He was relieved to see that the
gentleman was alone, and, looking
as bold as possible, he asked,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do you want a boy, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without answering, the &rsquo;Squire
peeped over the top of his glasses,
but tried in vain to make out who
he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know your face, my young
friend,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t call
your name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederick Carleton, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I know now! You&rsquo;re
the young lad who said, &lsquo;I thank
you,&rsquo; when you received the book
in school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you again for it, sir.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
I have read it a great many times.
I have it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you want to be a flour and
grain merchant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I should like that
best of anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to sea with
your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother wants me to stay with
her. If it were not for that, my
brother-in-law would take me into
his store.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixteen, last April.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ay! ay! And what can you
do, my boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almost anything, sir. Mother
brought me up to work. Ever
since I was seven years old I have
sawed and split wood. I like to
work, sir, and that made me want
to come here; there seems enough
to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rsquo;Squire Long took out his watch.
&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he said to himself;
&ldquo;I must be at the bank at ten. I
shall be in the city till five. Well,
Frederick, you may tell your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
mother that I will do myself the
pleasure of calling on her after tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took his pen without another
word, but smiled when Fred exclaimed,
warmly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir;&rdquo; and then went
on with his writing.</p>

<p>Exactly at seven o&rsquo;clock he
drove to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told my partners,&rdquo; he said to
the lady, &ldquo;what I knew of the lad;
and, though we don&rsquo;t really need
another hand, yet they gave up to
the whims of an old man, who has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
taken a fancy to a boy that says
&lsquo;thank you&rsquo; so earnestly. I&rsquo;ve had
my eye on the lad for a good many
years; and he may enter the store
of Long, Haynes, &amp; Long as soon
as he pleases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither Mrs. Carleton nor her son
failed to express their gratitude to
the kind old gentleman for acceding
so cheerfully to their wishes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m about,&rdquo; he
answered, laughing; &ldquo;I believe in
God&rsquo;s promise to the children of
those that love him, and keep his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
commandments. I mean to make
Frederick my confidential clerk;
and I expect to get the best part
of the bargain.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE GRATEFUL DOG.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>ANY people wondered
by what piece of good
luck so young a boy as
Fred Carleton was taken into the
most prosperous store in town.</p>

<p>The mother and son did not fail
to ascribe it to the over-ruling care
of their heavenly Father.</p>

<p>They recognized in this event a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
new source of gratitude; for they
knew he put the kind thought into
&rsquo;Squire Long&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>Fred entered into his new employment
with all the energy of his
character, and soon convinced the
other partners that he meant to
do his part faithfully.</p>

<p>Even here his quick appreciation
of kindness and the heartiness with
which he said &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for the
least favor, won him many friends.
The idea of his having gained his
present situation, merely by showing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
his gratitude, caused him to
think much on the subject, both
of his indebtedness to God and to
his Christian parents.</p>

<p>One Sabbath day he and his
mother passed all their time out of
church in looking up instances in
the Bible where gratitude for kindness
was shown from man to man;
as, for instance, David&rsquo;s friendship
to Jonathan&rsquo;s family, on account
of their former kindness to himself.
Also his kindness to Barzillai, in
allowing him to live where he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
pleased, because the old man had
provided him food when he lay hid
at Mahanaim.</p>

<p>They read the account of Joseph
in prison, and the ingratitude of
the chief butler, who forgot his
promise to plead for Joseph with
Pharaoh.</p>

<p>Soon after this time, a packet of
letters was received from Captain
Carleton, by a schooner the Adolphus
had met on her passage out.
Curiously enough, Frederick&rsquo;s letter
contained an incident on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
very subject which of late had occupied
so many of their thoughts.</p>

<p>As I have no doubt it will please
my young readers, I shall copy it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Son</span>,&mdash;You will remember
that I told you I had
engaged to take out several passengers
to India. There was one
more than I expected. This was
a noble dog, of the St. Bernard
breed. He was the property of a
lady who had formerly lived in
India, and was returning there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
with her three children, after a
visit to her home in America.
Mrs. Lenox has two sons and one
daughter, a little fairy, the pet of
all on board. The sons are indolent,
quarrelsome fellows, who
not only make themselves unhappy,
but also try to annoy their
mother in every way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inez, the little girl, never comes
on deck without being accompanied
by C&aelig;sar, the great dog. He is
her companion, protector, and
friend. He follows her gravely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
up and down the deck, lying by
her side when she is quiet, or
giving his body as a pillow for
her to lie upon. I have often seen
her soundly sleeping with her curly
head resting on his shaggy hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither of the boys likes the
dog. They shut him up, blind his
eyes, and play all manner of tricks
upon him. One day C&aelig;sar came
on deck limping badly. I examined
his foot and found it deeply
cut. I still suspect it was the
work of Lawrence, the eldest boy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
Inez was almost frantic with grief.
She insisted on holding the bandages
while the mate bound up the
wound, all the time weeping over
her pet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;C&aelig;sar fully appreciated her
affection. He looked mournfully
in her face, wagging his tail, and,
as soon as the dressing was completed,
began to lick her hands and
face in token of his gratitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every day the wound was
carefully dressed, Inez standing
by and caressing the dog. At the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
end of a week the cut was almost
entirely healed. The little girl
could scarcely express her joy.
She danced up and down the deck,
or rode on C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s back, holding
on to his shaggy hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One morning I went on deck
and saw Inez playing near the bow
of the ship. Next I heard a
scream, and saw C&aelig;sar leap into
the water. My heart gave one
great bound, and then the loud
cry, &lsquo;Child overboard!&rsquo; made all
hearts quail with fear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
&ldquo;There was a stiff breeze, and
the vessel making near ten knots
an hour. My fear was that before
the boats could be lowered we
should be too far off; but I was
mistaken. The grateful dog
plunged down when he saw his
mistress sink, and rose with her
clothes firmly grasped in his teeth.
Then he commenced swimming
after the vessel, while the sailors
in the boats were making toward
him as fast as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a moment of silent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
rejoicing when our pretty Inez was
safe on board again. Mrs. Lenox
wept and strained the dripping
child to her heart, after which she
hugged faithful C&aelig;sar, drenched
as he was, in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a dog can feel happiness,&mdash;of
which I have no doubt,&mdash;C&aelig;sar
did during the rest of that day.
The sailors rubbed his coat dry, and
fed him sumptuously. Everybody
praised him; but what he enjoyed
more than all else was the sight
of Inez brought on deck by her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
mother, and set down by his side.
He walked round her, smelled her
clothes, seeming to fear they were
still damp, then licked her hands
and face, wagging his tail, giving
short, joyful barks, and trying, as
well as he knew how, to show her
his delight at having had it in his
power to save her life as a return
for all her care of him.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>During the weeks which followed,
Fred and his sister talked
much of the noble dog and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
grateful friend Inez. They thought
Inez&rsquo; mother could not be grateful
enough to the affectionate creature,
and made many plans respecting
the way they would show their
gratitude if they were in her
place.</p>

<p>Fred said, &ldquo;I would build a beautiful
dog-house with a top like one
of the heathen temples, and have
an account of C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s heroism
printed in large letters on a signboard
over the front.&rdquo; But Hatty
thought that C&aelig;sar would better
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
appreciate good care, plenty of
meat, and Inez&rsquo; fond caresses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you feel so,&rdquo; remarked
Mrs. Carleton. &ldquo;It was a
noble act in the dog, though I suppose
he ran no great risk of losing
his own life. Dogs, especially of
the St. Bernard breed, are quite
at home in the water. But, Fred,
can you think of any man who not
only risked his life, but freely gave
it up for yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred&rsquo;s eyes dropped to the floor
as he answered,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, mother, Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is he sometimes called?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The God-man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been grateful to
him, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I do love him, mother,
though I never can love him
enough for all he has done.&rdquo;</p>
